Note for GitHub:

This document introduces a key evolution for the MIU system: moving from a "geographical" analysis of strings (exact values) to an "abstract topological" understanding of their patterns and behavior. This abstraction enables generalized learning and intelligent search pruning, paving the way for advanced concepts like state superposition and autonomous rule generation. A fundamental step towards emergent and creative intelligence.
